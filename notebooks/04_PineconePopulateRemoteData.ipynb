This typically involves installing necessary libraries, configuring authentication with your API keys, and setting up the required dependencies for the RAG workflow using tools like LangChain.\\n\\nFor detailed instructions on setting up the environment and building a RAG Chatbot, you can refer to the documentation and guides provided by Pinecone on their website.'"
